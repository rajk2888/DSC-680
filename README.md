# Project Name: Model for Preventive Maintenance based on Predictive Analytics
# Author *Rajkumar Kuppuswami* 
# DSC-680
## Project Description: 
In this project, I'm utilizing an example scenario to create a predictive maintenance model, with the purpose of predicting machine breakdowns related to specific components. 
This predictive model's analysis involves feature engineering, feature selection, labeling, training, and evaluation. Python packages are used to create predictive models.
For development and testing reasons, follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local system. 
Notes on how to deploy the project on a live system can be found in the deployment section.
